## About the project
This is the repository of the final degree project *Implementation of a privacy-aware REST infrastructure for GTD*.

The Productivity Methodology "Getting Things Done" (GTD), created by David Allen is one of the most effective methods for personal task organization. Its objective is to maximize productivity through the consolidation of all tasks, projects and activities in one place.

## Project parts
This project consists of two main parts:

### Backend (API Rest)
The backend infrastructure consists of an Api-Rest. Some aspects of this infrastructure are the use of OAuth authorization standard to provide security to the API.

### Frontend
For the frontend we are developing some clients to consume the API. The main feature of this clients is that they are built with the multiplatform framework React-Native, so with practically the same code, it will run the same application on different platforms like mobile or desktop with multiple environments, like IOS, Android, Windows among others. Another feature of the clients is that they support offline mode.
